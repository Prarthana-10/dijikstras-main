# Dijkstra’s Path-finding Explorer
Welcome to the Dijkstra’s Path-finding Explorer repository! This self-initiated project, developed in June 2024, showcases a dynamic web app designed to visualize Dijkstra’s algorithm in action for real-time shortest path-finding.

## Project Overview
The Dijkstra’s Path-finding Explorer is an interactive tool that allows users to design complex mazes and observe the efficiency of Dijkstra's algorithm in finding the shortest path. 

## Key features include:
* Real-Time Path-Finding: The app calculates the shortest path in real-time, utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm.
* Visual Animations: Users can see the algorithm's process visually, including node exploration and path discovery.
* Maze Customization: Create intricate mazes with up to 200 nodes and 50 walls, and watch the algorithm navigate through the complexity.
* Live Distance Calculations: Displays live calculations of distances as the algorithm progresses.
* Accurate Backtracking: Provides accurate backtracking through up to 200 nodes to identify the shortest path.
* Interactive Maze Design: Users can design mazes and observe how Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path through the maze.
* Performance: The tool showcases the efficiency of Dijkstra's algorithm, finding the shortest path 50% faster even in complex scenarios.
* Visualization: Visual animations depict the exploration and path-finding process, making it easy to understand the algorithm's workings.
